#  Map Pattern
################################################################################

As you learned in lecture, the map pattern is one in which an operation is performed independently on a elements in a collection in parallel

#  Problem Statement
################################################################################

OSNAP Executives need a tool to recover their PIN from the associated hash. You will write a program to do so in each of the three paradigms.

#  What to do
################################################################################

1. Check out / update your repository

git pull origin 

2. Run the Makefile, look at the source code and output of each of the programs.

3. Run the serial program using by executing the shell script testInit
type ./testInit at your command prompt, this runs the program multiple times
with different (small) inputs.  The program can be run manually with ./pass_serail `cat keys/01000000`

4. Write a parallel version of the program in Cilk, TBB, and OpenMP.
Follow the convention of <app>_openmp, <app>_cilk, <app>_tbb for source and
executable files. I will rely on this for my own grading purposes.

5. Update the Makefile entries for the other three build targets with compilation commands for source files.

6. Get timing results for all implementations using the keys/99999999 file as 
input. This should include the serial program, and your parallel versions with 
the number of threads set to 32.  Furthermore, plot speedup for your openmp 
version as you set OMP_NUM_THREADS to the values [1,4,16,32,64] (use more values
if you feel like it).  Include your results in a PDF file called results.pdf 
and include a description of the contributions from each group member.

7. Commit the source files, updated Makefile, and PDF of the results to your group repository.  Please do not add the executable files to the repository.
